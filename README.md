===========

The goal of this project is to implement overconvergent modular symbols and families of overconvergenet modular symbols in Sage.


I. Installation instructions

The code in this repository is meant to be added to an already existing Sage installation. The working copy of the code is appropriately located in the folder named "working_copy". In that folder, you will find a file named "INSTALLATION_INSTRUCTIONS.txt" that explains the steps involved in installing this code into Sage 5.9.


II. Copyright

Several files might not have copyright notices on them. For those the files, just pretend the following notice is present, but probably with more names in it.
